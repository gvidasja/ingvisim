An Expression is something which evaluates to a single value. 4 is an expression. 2*(4*5+myVar) is also an expression. And once we support 
function calls 5 * doStuff(3,4)) will also be an expression.

A Statement is an expression which doesn’t return a value. For simplicity sake we’ll say that all statements return null.

A Block is a sequence of expressions or statements which are evaluated in order, and then returns the value of the final expression.

to add a feature :
define what we want, add a new grammar rule, create a new AST class, add an action to the semantics, and add a test case.
